# 6502_Processor
The purpose of this Repository is to hold the files for my experimentation with the 6502 Processor. 
The 6502 is an 8-bit Microprocessor which launched in 1975. The files in this repository should mainly consist of Assembly Language written for the 6502 Processor. This Processor was found in the Commodore 64, Apple 2 computer, and even in Bender's head from Futurama.
